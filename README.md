# Companion repository for the article "Cortical recurrence supports resilience to sensory variance in the primary visual cortex", to be published in Nature Communications Biology
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/368818425.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/368818425)

# Usage 
* Download the raw data from figshare [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Ladret_et_al_2023_Cortical_recurrence_supports_resilience_to_sensory_variance_in_the_primary_visual_cortex_/23366588) and unzip it in the folder preprocessing/cat/
* Run the preprocessing pipeline (./preprocessing/main.py)
* In the meantime, it's possible to also run the model (./model/feedforward.ipynb ; ./model/recurrent.ipynb ; ./model/timing.ipynb)
* Once preprocessing pipeline has done its job, it's now possible to run the main pipeline that generates figures in ./postprocessing/main.py
